Letmess-PoC is a little collaborative typing game that can be played by as many players. Press any key, the key code will show up in a random placed circle. The color is randomly selected for each player and will re-generate upon refresh. Whatever key typed by one player will be simultaneously shown on the screen of every player. The play history is timestamped and can be retrieved upon refresh. It will show the number of players currently online at the bottom.
